## Requirements

4. Semantic HTML
5. HTML validated by a validation service

### The Process

- Started by adding the basic construction of a navbar
- Create a div for the about me section
- Create a fixed footer
- Create a consistent style and theme for the webpages
- Once the about me page was finished, that framework was transferred to the other two pages
- Rearrange content as desired whilst checking for responsiveness
- Quickly discovering that making sure the size of everything is acceptable on most devices is quite the challenge... Many hours on this alone
- Added current contact information
- Updated the aboutme section with a photo and brief paragraph
